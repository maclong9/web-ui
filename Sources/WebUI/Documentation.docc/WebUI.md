# ``WebUI``

Create beautiful static and dynamic websites using Swift.

## Overview

WebUI is a Swift library for creating websites with a declarative, component-based approach. It allows you to write HTML using Swift's type-safe syntax, with built-in support for styling, accessibility, and optimization. You can use WebUI for both static site generation and dynamic server-rendered content.

The library is built on a modular architecture that organizes functionality into focused components, making it easy to use only what you need and to extend the library in a consistent way.

With WebUI, you can:
- Build type-safe HTML using Swift
- Apply styling using a Tailwind CSS-inspired API
- Create reusable components
- Generate static sites with optimized markup
- Create dynamic server-rendered content
- Add Markdown content with front matter support
