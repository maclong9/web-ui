# WebUI

A library for generating Web User Interfaces in a simple, type-safe, and consistent manner.

No need to worry if you are not an HTML expert, this library contains extensive documentation explaining the semantic meaning for each of the elements it can render. Building off of a design system inspired by modern utility-first CSS frameworks allows you to build beautiful looking websites without overthinking your styles. Finally adding common functionality to your web application via javsacript is a nice and simple process.
