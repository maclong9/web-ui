# WebUI

## What This Library Is Not

- This library is not intended to be a full reimplimentation of HTML, CSS and JS in Swift
- This library is not designed to be a front end framework or extensive site generator
- It is not supposed to be used to create highly custom frontend experiences

## What This Library Is

- A way to write common web user interface patterns in a concise manner
  - For example your basic `header + main + footer` layout
  - In the future more variants of these basic components may be added
- A convenience for full stack applications written using server side Swift
- It is to be used for generating simple sites that do not require much custom code

## Basic Usage

```swift
```
